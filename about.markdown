# Mission: To enhance the participation of underrepresented minorities in Astronomy and Astrophysics at all levels of experience.

#### Goals:
To provide an overview of the status of minorities in Astronomy, including identifying areas of concerns and opportunities. To advise the AAS about these and formulate policies for the society to consider. To establish and maintain a statistical base on the participation of minorities in Astronomy over time.
To act as a facilitator in the communication between minorities themselves, and the programs and jobs which might interest them. This includes putting students in contact with more advanced students or professionals, fostering "mentoring," and "networking" in aid of moving people into programs or jobs.
To act as a central contact point to other societies or institutions with a useful relation to the mission.

#### Methods: 
The AAS will supply the CSMA with the resources needed to compile and maintain its informational databases. The CSMA will maintain and update a website (as part of the AAS website), which will make available to the community at large all appropriate information. It will be constructed to facilitate communication between those offering assistance, advice, education or employment, and those seeking it. The committee will actively publicize its efforts in appropriate forums to maximize the number of participants in its activities. The CSM will meet regularly, electronically or in person, to monitor its success and create new policies or activities. It will remain aware of other efforts germane to its mission, and make use of them (and avoid duplication) whenever possible.
